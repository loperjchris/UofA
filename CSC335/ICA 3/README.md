# tictactoe-coverage

For this In-Class Activity, we have provided a partial implementation of a game of Tic Tac Toe. We have a model that represents a 3x3 board and a controller that implements a function ``isGameOver()`` which should return true if the game is over because someone won or there is a tie. 

Your job is to finish the test cases to get 100% coverage of ``isGameOver()``. With the one test case we already provided, we're at 42%. (This is what we meant by the first test case often being the most important from a coverage perspective.)

Try not to add more tests than you need.
