Hi,
Welcome to POWER TOWER!



Connecting Instructions. As a server, simply press "Host a Game" and look in the console, that address is the location that the server is currently listening on.
As a client, you must press "Connect" which will transfer you to a different screen. On this screen are two text fields and two buttons.
The two text fields are address and port respectively and pressing on the connect button will directly try to connect you to that address. Otherwise, you can try to use the
"Scan for Games" feature, which uses your OS's ARP table to check if there are any open games on your network(essentially localhost gameplay, if you've played minecraft).
The connection should start instantly, if it doesn't, then please restart the game ensuring that the process is fully shut down, as there might have been interference in the socket connection.

Chat Introduction. The chat client is a hacked together P2P client, kind of. It tries to send messages to the desired location first, by connecting directly to it. If it cannot do that,
it passes the message along its peers until it meets the desired person or bounces infinitely. 

Chat Usage Instruction. Login with a username and password, if you haven't logged in before pretend you're signing up for an account, it will save those credentials for the next time you log in.
Then enter the desired ip address and port, those are the first two fields, the bottom field is the message that you want to send to the other person. And that's it.
